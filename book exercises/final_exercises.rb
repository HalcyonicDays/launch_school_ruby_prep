What's the major difference between an Array and a Hash?
- a hash contains key-value pairs, which can be useful for categorized data
- on the other hand, an array is a guaranteed fixed-order list
- also, arrays are accessed by index, while hashes are accessed by key,
- although both can be searched by value.
=end
# Create a Hash, with one key-value pair, using both Ruby syntax styles
h1 = {a: 1}
h2 = {:a => 1}
# bonus
h3 = Hash.new()
h3[:a] = 1


# Suppose you have a hash h = {a:1, b:2, c:3, d:4}
h = {a:1, b:2, c:3, d:4}
# 1. Get the value of key `:b`.
h[:b]

# 2. Add to this hash the key:value pair `{e:5}`
h[:e] = 5         # or, alternatively:
h.merge!({e: 5})  # but don't do both (at least not in this order)

# 3. Remove all key:value pairs whose value is less than 3.5
h.select { |_key, value| value < 3.5}.each_key {|key| h.delete(key)}
h.delete_if { |_key, value| value < 3.5 }

# Can hash values be arrays? Can you have an array of hashes? (give examples)
# yes.  The below are uncommented for easier reading, and because they do not
# throw any exceptions when they are evaluated.
{a: [1, 2, 3]}          or {a: arr}
[{a: 1}, {b: 2, c: 3}]  or [h1, h2, h3]

Given the following data structures, write a program that copies the information 
from the array into the empty hash that applies to the correct person.
Expected output:

  "Sally Johnson"=>{:email=>"sally@email.com", :address=>"404 Not Found Dr.",  :phone=>"123-234-3454"}

                ]

#What will the following program output?

if hash1 == hash2
  puts "These hashes are the same!"
else
  puts "These hashes are not the same!"
end

# => "These hashes are the same!"
# This is because the keys and values are identical. Order is irrelevant.
# But this raises the question of *where* the information for the key ordering
# is stored, since the triple eqaulity also returns true
puts hash1.object_id
puts hash2.object_id

# aha! so triple equals (===) doesn't check that it's the same object, but rather
# checks if the object has the same properties/values?  that was unexpected
# https://stackoverflow.com/questions/7156955/whats-the-difference-between-equal-eql-and
# okay, so it looks like == *does* check if the objects are the same object, but the
# Hash class overrides this behavior to check merely if the hashes would respond in the same
# way.  From an OOP perspective, that's useful since the behavior of hash1 and hash2 are
# identical in most cases outside of ".object_id" and where order of the entries matters.

puts hash1 == hash2     # => true
puts hash1 === hash2    # => true
puts hash1.eql? hash2   # => true
puts hash1.equal? hash2 # => false
# this is because the ".equal?" method hasn't been overridden by the Hash class, so it 
# maintains the original behavior of "==" described above.

Challenge: In exercise 11, we manually set the contacts hash values one 
by one. Now, programmatically loop or iterate over the contacts hash 
from exercise 11, and populate the associated data from the contact_data 
array. Hint: you will probably need to iterate over 
([:email, :address, :phone]), and some helpful methods might be the
 Array shift and first methods.

 As a bonus, see if you can figure out how to make it work with 
 multiple entries in the contacts hash.

# perhaps my solution already does something like this?
